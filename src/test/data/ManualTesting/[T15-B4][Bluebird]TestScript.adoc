== Setting up Bluebird

.  Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or later installed in your Computer.
+
[NOTE]
Having any Java 8 version is not enough. +
This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
+
.  Download from IVLE all files submitted by our team
(i.e. jar file, user guide, developer guide, sample data, test script, project portfolio pages)into an empty folder.

== Loading up SampleData.xml

. There is no need to load the SampleData.xml as Bluebird already has a preset sample data when you first launch it.
. If there are any errors loading up Bluebird without the SampleData.xml, simply create a new folder called
"data" in the folder Bluebird.jar is in, rename the SampleData.xml to "addressbook.xml" and place it in the "data" folder.

== Launching Bluebird for the first time

If there were no "addressbook.xml" detected when you launch Bluebird, a quick start tutorial will be launched as shown in
the user guide section 2. This tutorial will guide you on Bluebird's UI and Parent Mode(IMPORTANT).

== Important step to enable all commands

By default, when Bluebird is launched it is set to limit the number of commands available.
In order to enable all the commands, please type "parent" into the command box and press enter.

== Test Cases
You can choose whether or not you want to continue with the tutorial. +
