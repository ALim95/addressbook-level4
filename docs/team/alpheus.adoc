== Project: Bluebird
Written in Java language, Bluebird is a desktop based organisational tool for the working parent on the go. Bluebird is suitable
for a variety of day-to-day management tasks, including managing appointments for both yourself and your
child, and also organising the contact information from your Address Book. +

Included in this portfolio are all the enhancements, features and tests that Alpheus Lim Wei Xiang has contributed to the project.


*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B4/main/blob/master/collated/main/Alim95.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B4/main/blob/master/collated/test/Alim95.md[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Sort

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users will want to view the list of contacts sorted for them based on their name, phone, email or address.
Some users find the contact they want by scrolling through the list as opposed to typing and this will aid them.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: First time tutorial

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=tutorial]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Currently when new users launch Bluebird for the first time, they will be lost as to what Bluebird has to offer and also what different UI panels mean.
Therefore, there is a need to provide first time users of Bluebird a step-by-step tutorial on how Bluebird works.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=tutorial]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Enhanced Find

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users may want to search for the contact not just by their names, but also by their phone number, email
, address and tags as well. This enhancement gives users the choice to decide how they would want
to search for the contact they want.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Pin/Unpin contact

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=pinunpin]
include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=listpin]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Users may have some important contacts that they need to have quick access to at all times. Hence,
this feature will solve the problem for them.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=pinunpin]

#End of Extract#

---

=== Enhancement Added: Parent Mode Command

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=parentmode]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Parents may be worried that their child will delete or alter any of their important contacts/tasks. Therefore, there
is a need to limit the number of available commands that the child is able to use.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=parentmode]

#End of Extract#
