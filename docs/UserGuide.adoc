== Introduction

=== Welcome to Bluebird!

Bluebird is a desktop based organisational tool for the working parent on the go. Bluebird is suitable for a variety of
day-to-day management tasks, including managing appointments for both yourself and your child, and also organising the
contact information from your Address Book.

Bluebird has many capabilities to suit the different needs of the working parent. It assists in keeping the agendas of
your working life in order, and simultaneously manages the responsibilities in your personal life.

One of Bluebird's strength's is its ability to accomodate both the working parent and also provide a source of contact
storing and schedule management that is child-friendly but at the same time child-proof. The team at Bluebird put this
into action with the Parent Mode and Child Mode Protocol. With Bluebird, parents no longer have to worry about losing
valuable scheduling information while allowing their child to learn and explore technology.

=== Authors

BlueBird is created by the BlueBird Team of 4 members, namely Deepak Buddha, Alpheus Lim, Azizi Azfar and Wyn K Heng.

=== The Bluebird Help System

Before we get started, the Bluebird Team has provided you with the information necessary to understand how you can

Developer's Guide, should you be interested to find out more about how the team at Bluebird made this product possible.
However, you may easily receive guidance as you go along by typing `help` into the command field, or
simply press the `F1` key. Read on to begin your journey with Bluebird.
